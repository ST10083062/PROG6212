# PROG6212
Task 1
Explanation:
1. Recipe recipe = new Recipe(); This line creates a new instance of the 
Recipe class, which is used throughout the program to manipulate recipe 
data.
2. while (true) This sets up an infinite loop that will run until the program is 
exited.
3. Console.WriteLine("Enter '1' to enter recipe details"); This line 
prompts the user to enter the number '1' to enter recipe details.
4. string choice = Console.ReadLine(); This line reads the user's input as 
a string.
5. switch (choice) This sets up a switch statement that allows the program 
to execute different code blocks based on the user's input.
Final Answer
The code defines a Recipe class that stores details about a recipe such as its 
ingredients, quantities, units, and steps. It provides methods to enter, display, scale, 
reset quantities and clear a recipe. The Main() method of the Program class presents 
the user with a menu of options to interact with the Recipe class and exits when the 
user chooses to exit
